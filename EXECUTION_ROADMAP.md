**Where to look:**
- LinkedIn (search "marketing agency owner")

- Indie Hackers community
- Product Hunt makers
- Reddit (r/entrepreneur, r/marketing)
- Local business directories

**Outreach message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm building a tool specifically for agencies like yours that manage multiple clients. 

I noticed you [specific observation about their agency].

Would you be interested in free early access? I'd love to get your feedback on whether this solves real problems you face.

[Brief value prop - save 10 hours/week on approvals]

Happy to show you a quick demo if interested.

[Your name]
```

### Onboard Them (Free)
**Process:**
1. Send invitation link
2. Schedule 15-min onboarding call
3. Walk them through:
   - Creating first client
   - Scheduling a post
   - Client approval flow
   - Client dashboard
4. Let them use it for 1 week
5. Follow up for feedback

### Collect Feedback
**Questions to ask:**
1. "What was the hardest part of getting started?"
2. "What feature surprised you most (good or bad)?"
3. "Would you pay for this? How much?"
4. "What's missing that would make this essential?"
5. "Would you recommend this to other agencies?"

### Get Testimonials
**Ask for:**
- Written testimonial (1-2 sentences)
- Video testimonial (30 seconds)
- Case study (if they're comfortable)
- Permission to use their name/company

### Identify "Aha Moments"
**Look for:**
- When they say "Oh, this is exactly what I needed"
- When they invite their first client
- When they schedule their first post
- When they see the activity feed
- When they realize time saved

## 🚨 Red Flags (When to Pivot)

**If after 30 days:**
- ❌ No agencies say "I'd pay for this"
- ❌ Onboarding takes > 10 minutes
- ❌ No one invites clients
- ❌ Everyone says "nice but not essential"

**Then:**
- Pivot positioning
- Pivot features
- Pivot target market
- Or pivot entirely

**But first: Validate.**

---

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Validation > Features** - Test with real users early
2. **Time Saved > AI** - Sell workflow, not AI
3. **Simple > Complex** - Remove friction constantly
4. **Feedback > Assumptions** - Ask, don't guess
5. **Distribution > Product** - Great product + no users = failure

---

## 📋 Daily Checklist

**Every day, ask:**
- [ ] Did I make it easier for agencies?
- [ ] Did I remove friction?
- [ ] Did I talk to a potential user?
- [ ] Did I validate an assumption?
- [ ] Did I move closer to "banger" status?
