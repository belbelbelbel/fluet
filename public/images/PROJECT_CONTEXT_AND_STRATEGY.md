## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS (Don't Mess This Up)

### ❌ Do NOT Try to Be:
- BuzzSumo (we adapt their logic, not copy)
- Hootsuite (we're creator-focused, not enterprise)
- ChatGPT (we're specialized, not general)
- Stripe (payments come later, not first)

### ✅ Instead:
- Start as "Creator Intelligence + Post Execution"
- Everything else layers on later
- Focus on daily actionable growth
- Solve one problem perfectly before adding more

## 🧠 THINKING FRAMEWORK (For AI Assistants)

### When Analyzing or Building:

1. **Always Ask:**
   - Does this solve a real daily pain?
   - Is this actionable (not just data)?
   - Does this work for Nigerian creators?
   - Is this mobile-first and low data?

2. **Research Approach:**
   - Look for patterns, not random data
   - Measure engagement velocity, not just totals
   - Group by topic, not keywords
   - Find what's rising, not what's peaking

3. **Output Style:**
   - Direct recommendations ("Post this today")
   - Not charts or dashboards
   - Actionable insights, not raw data
   - Nigerian context always

4. **Feature Priority:**
   - Pain A first: "I don't know what to post"
   - Pain B second: "I forget / don't have time"
   - Pain C third: "Posting doesn't bring customers"

## 📝 FINAL NOTES

This is not "another content tool."
This is a **Creator Operating System** built around how people actually behave today.

We're not copying BuzzSumo—we're adapting their research logic for African creators.

We're not building for "creators" generically—we're building for specific Nigerian segments with specific needs.

We're not guessing—we're researching, measuring, and finding patterns.

**The goal:** Predictable, actionable, daily growth for Nigerian creators through intelligent content ideas + stacked post scheduling + auto-posting.

**The mindset:** Research-driven, behavior-matched, locally-focused, mobile-first.

**The approach:** Solve Pain A perfectly, build trust, then layer Pain B and C.
